Updating the application
========================

All you have to do is:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd vulnerability-lookup/


Updating the CVE Record editor
------------------------------

We are using the `Vulnogram editor <https://github.com/Vulnogram/Vulnogram>`_.
The frontend is directly bundled in a HTML template of Vulnerability Lookup.

If you want to update the bundle you must first generate only the frontend of Vulnogram.
Follow the instructions
`here <https://github.com/Vulnogram/Vulnogram?tab=readme-ov-file#browser-mode-deployment>`_.

Then from the generated index.html file extract the part ... and copy it
in website/web/templates/vulnogram/index.html in the Jinja block ``vulnogram``.
